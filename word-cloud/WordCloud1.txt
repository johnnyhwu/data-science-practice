"deliberate" drone incursions has caused travel chaos for hundreds of thousands of passengers and left many more wondering how something like this could even happen in the first place.

Police on Friday were still searching for the perpetrators who have brought air traffic in and out of London's Gatwick Airport to a halt for more than 32 hours over three days.
Flights have been diverted or grounded after continued sightings of drones, believed by Sussex Police to be of an "industrial specification," near the airfield.
Ahead of one of the busiest travel periods of the year, here's a look at what risks drones pose to air travel.
While it is illegal to operate drones within 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) of a UK airfield boundary, there is nothing physically stopping pilots from doing so.
"There are laws within this country to prevent drones from flying within a certain distance from airports, but there are no effective countermeasures in place to prevent it in practice," Philip Banks-Welsh, head of drone law at Royds Withy King law firm, told CNN. "At the moment the industry relies on users flying drones responsibly, which I'm afraid just isn't good enough."
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says it is trying to tighten regulation of drones and there are calls for all drones to be registered; but that's unlikely to happen anytime soon.
